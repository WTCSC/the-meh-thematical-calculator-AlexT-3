## Meh-Thematical Calculator
### Alexandria Tuell
> This program is an unenthusiastic calculator that is able to complete basic math operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division while outputting sarcastic messages.

#### Requirements:
* Python3

#### Startup and usage:
Within the terminal, type in the command `python3 mehth.py`
The program will first ask you to give it 2 numbers. Then, it asks for the operation you would like to calculate the numbers with. 
```
Ugh, it's you. Welcome to meh-culator I guess.
Give me your first number.4
Okay now I need your second number.9
What operation do you want? (+, -, *, /)*
```
The program then outputs the solution to your equation.
```
 Your total is 36.0 . Is that all or are you gonna keep bothering me?
```
